# 3D Objective Digital Stains
A 3D Objective Digital Stain is able to show the information structure of a DNA or RNA sequence in a graphical manner. In this case, the ODS is computed using the local frequency of the symbols from a sliding window. In the 3D version, the overlapping values (similar sliding windows) are represented by a gradient from black to red.
